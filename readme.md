# App Direction 

Decided to keep usage of the API down just so I can have finer control over the app. Since it's just going to be for personal use, I want to have my own database - most likely using Firebase. I can call the BGG API using the search command to pull in game info on a per-game basis as I add new games to my collection. 

To populate it initially, I'll just have a manual collection import button, copy over the data that I want in a friendlier JSON format and toss the rest - so I'll only need to use that weird XML syntax for the data fetcher/API wrapper and not for the rest of the app. 

So:
	Need an API wrapper/call to:
	- import inital collection info, store to database
	- import relevant info on a per-game basis 
		- will add ability to add game by objectId property if that ends up being necessary


I suppose the first order of business is to finish building out the main functionality, then hook it up to firebase and store my existing collection. That will give me a good base to operate off of.

# UI

## Adding game to collection
- perform initial search with 'exact' parameter, then add option to expand it to similar titles - "didn't find what you were looking for?" sort of thing
- display relevant info on search results page - full game title, box art, release date
